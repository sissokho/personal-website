It all began when i joined the [Check4Decision project](https://check4decision.univ-thies.sn/) in November 2019. My first task was to help the then lead developer build the project's website by using a template. It didn't took much time.

All that was needed was to change the text, replace images and add some custom css styles.

It looked decent but over the time i felt the need to redesign it.

## Why redesign it

I wanted to give the website a fresh look for many reasons:

-   I didn't like the design.
-   I have never been satisfied with the fact of using a template.
-   It was something I was not proud to put in my portfolio.
-   The first rendering was slow. There were to many heavy images.

So for all this reasons, I decided to do an entire makeover.

## Choosing the tech stack

I decided to stick with the same stack i used to build my [personal website](/work/personal-website):

-   Jigsaw
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Alpine.js

I was quite satisfied with it and i enjoyed the process. I didn't see any reason to change it.

## Performance

A part from the visual design, make it fast was the next big goal. The previous website was taking quite some time to load (around 3-4 seconds).

My main focus was to optimize the images by:

-   compressing them.
-   Loading them at the right time with lazy loading.
-   Cropping them to an ideal size.

## Brand new website

So after some hard work and many iterations over the design, [here it is](https://check4decision.univ-thies.sn/):

It looks better than the previous one and is faster. It take no more than {seconds} to load.

## Conclusion

It it always difficult to redesign a website. There is always the pressure to make it look better and load faster.

But as every work, there is still some room for improvement especially in the accessibility part which im not very good at but i'm always making effort to apply it in some degree.
